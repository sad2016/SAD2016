        <p>Founded in 2015 by Mr.Karim and Miss Sanjana, Khaiye Khabo has started its long journey as a class project of a course. Since Khaiyekhabo first started out, our passion for helping other people with trusted south-asian recipes, providing the best platform for all food-lovers drove us to  do intense research and gave us the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online recipe provider. We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky, trusted, uniqeue wing of the recipe industry. </p>
        <p>We hope you enjoy our recipes as much as we enjoy offering them to you. Moreover, we hope you learn new recipes everyday based on this platform and enrich the south-asian cuisine by sharing your new recipes. If you have any questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to contact us.<br/>

Sincerely,<br/>
Nabil Tahmidul Karim, Sanjana Jain</p>
