        <h1>Welcome</h1>

        <p>At <strong>Khaiye Khabo,</strong> we welcome you to a delicious world of exquisite south asian dishes available within a click away. With a wide range of cuisines to choose from, we guarantee you a sumptuous feast experience in our website.</p>

        <p>Like many other global cuisines, South Asian cuisine is as varied as the countries on the continent. It is very much a part of the culture and history of the South Asian countries but there are some food commonalities between the various cultures. South Asian cuisine is exotic and flavorful. The clever use of cooking techniques and spices has transformed what were originally humble peasant food dishes into specialties that are now known the world over. Conversely, with many South Asian countries having a separate cuisine for the historical ruling King or Royal Family, the dichotomy between humble and royal food has lessened and dishes that were once only served to royalty can now be found in any common restaurant. </p>
